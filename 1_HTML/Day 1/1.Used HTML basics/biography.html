    <hr>

    <p>Bhanubhakta Acharya was born on 13 July 1814 (29 Ashadh 1871 BS) in the village of Chundi Ramgha, 
        Tanahun District, Nepal to Dhananjaya Acharya, and Dharmawati Acharya.[1] His father Dhananjaya Acharya
        was a government official and was the eldest of all brothers.
        Bhanubhakta received his primary education of Sanskrit at his home by his grandfather and later in Varanasi.</p>

    <p>South Asian languages including the Nepali language were limited mostly to an oral medium of language dissemination at the 
        time with little written context and literary influence. As most of the written texts of South Asia were dominated by Sanskrit,
        it was mostly inaccessible  to the general populace. As the Brahmins were the caste who excelled as teachers, scholars, and priests,
        the access to all of the religious scriptures and other literary works was only limited to them, and few who also could
        receive education and understand Sanskrit. Many poets had written poems in Sanskrit while Acharya started to write in the 
        Nepali language which not only popularized the language but also gained him acceptance from the Rana Rulers.<br><br>

        Acharya's benevolence towards Ram's heroic exploits brought in him an urgency to make his tale accessible to the 
        people who spoke Nepali. Since most people did not understand the Sanskrit language, he translated the epic into the
        Nepali language. Preserving the lyrical narration style of Ramayana his translations are believed by scholars to carry
        the same lyrical essence "Bhava and Marma" that rather than sounding like a poem sounded more like a song without 
        distorting the regional influence or the inner meaning of the Ramayana.<br><br>
        
        He did not receive any western education nor was familiar with foreign literature which kept his work and experiential 
        journey original to the vernacular literary system and brought strong Nepali flavor to his works. The key features of his 
        writings were simple yet strong with a sense of religion, a sense of simplicity, and the warmth of his country that not many
        other poets had been able to be compared. Belonging to a wealthy family, he never had any financial trouble and had an unremarkable 
        life until he met a grass cutter who wanted to give something to society so he could be remembered after death too. 
        The grass cutter's words were what inspired him to do something that would leave a mark on society.<br><br>
        
        He wrote two masterpieces in his life among which, one is the Bhanubhaktey Ramayan and the other is a letter 
        he wrote in verse form to the Prime Minister while he was in prison. He was made a scapegoat and sent to prison 
        due to some misunderstanding in signing the papers. In prison, his health deteriorated and he was given false hopes
        of being set free but his case was not even heard. So, he wrote a petition to the Prime Minister requesting his freedom, 
        which later became one of his great works. He not only won his freedom with his poem but was also given a bag of money 
        (He wrote in the same language the then prime minister want to force the public to use). When he died in 1868, he did not 
        know he would one day be one of the most revered poets of Nepal. His creation, however, was not published and he died
        without receiving credit for his contribution.<br><br>
        

        His works were published by Motiram Bhatta in 1887 after he found the manuscript and took it to Benaras, India for printing.
        One of Acharya's works is well known for its colorful, glowing praise of Kathmandu valley and its inhabitants. 
        lthough he is one of the most celebrated and revered poets of Nepal, his works are not as famous as other poets 
        in the history of Nepali literature.</p>
